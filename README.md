# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm
The basic idea of Page Replacement is; if there is a free page in the memory then use it. If there is no free page available, then we select one victim page which we would swap out of the virtual memory to the disk. The main objective of a good replacement algorithm is to achieve a low page fault rate.
